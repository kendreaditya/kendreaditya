# Hi, I'm Aditya 👋🏼

I like to learn and build cool things for fun and the betterment of mankind 🌎🌍🌏.

Talk to me about [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) - specifically [Hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics) and [Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta), [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), [brain-computer interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), and **whatever the latest AI/ML hype is**.
